## Hello! I am H17S3ðŸ‘‹
### I know Lua, Java, and Python, HTML and CSS and I am mastering each one every day. I aim to learn programming languages and master them so I can hopefully get a career out of it.
### I started off my journey learning lua and mastering it. While Lua is pretty cool it sometimes can't do as many things as other programming languages can do I also am very inspired by other developers my mission is to gain as much experience as I can and grow my problem-solving skills.
